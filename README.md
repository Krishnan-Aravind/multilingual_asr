This repo documents the experiments done as a part of probing the encoding representations of multilingual ASR systsems. The main experimentation here is to see how localized
linguistic information is in these embdeddings. Initial experimentation uses code switched speech to see how a Languge identifier performs across the board. 
The corpus used will be the [fleurs](https://huggingface.co/datasets/google/fleurs) corpus for initial experiments with monolingual speech. Then we move on to a suitable code-switched corpus.
